btree-framework

The btree-framework is aimed at programmers that are looking for associative data container classes capable of handling data sets at a very large scale. Said data containers are coming with an interface similar to the existing STL container classes map, multimap, set and multiset. Furthermore, iterators, with a random access qualifier enabled, are supported, which ought to allow for a quick interchange between this framework and existing STL containers. Also, an array type, that isn't suffering from any slow down when data is inserted or removed at the beginning of the list, is available. This array type has an interface similar to the STL class vector.
