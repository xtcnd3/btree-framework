1. Where to start

The folder ./doc holds two files containing the same documentation. One file is displaying the documentation as an Open Office Text file (.odt), while the other is a Portable Document Format file (.pdf). That documentation explains this b-tree framework in detail, but only a sub set of sections is required to understand to get started. See below:

2. How to build this framework under linux or windows


2.1. Linux

For this framework to compile, a compiler capable to support the C++11 dialect is required.
This release was tested with: GCC (C++) 6.2.1 20160916 (Fedora 24 x86_64)

To build the b-tree test bench execute the following commands:

cd .../to/your/projects/location
git clone --recursive https://github.com/andreas-steffens/btree-framework-testbench
cd btree-framework/src/btreetest
make debug

List of make file rules:
all								- runs regression, valgrind_report, coverage_report, performance, release
debug							- builds regression test binary with debug flags
release							- builds regression test binary with release flags
coverage						- builds regression test binary with debug and coverage flags
regression						- runs regression tests using debug binary
performance						- runs performance tests using release binary (this is not ready yet)
coverage_report					- runs regression tests using coverage binary and creates result displayed as HTML
valgrind_report					- runs regression tests using valgrind with debug binary (warning: takes days or maybe weeks to run)
clean							- removes any build file (may those be intermediate or final)
clean_coverage					- removes any coverage or coverage report file (may those be intermediate or final)
clean_regression_tests			- cleans all regression tests regardless of their result
clean_failed_regression_tests	- cleans all regression tests that returned with an error code
clean_coverage_tests			- cleans all code coverage tests regardless of their result
clean_failed_coverage_tests		- cleans all code coverage tests that returned with an error code
clean_validation_tests			- cleans all validation tests regardless of their result
clean_failed_validation_tests	- cleans all validation tests that returned with an error code
clean_tests						- runs clean_regression_tests clean_coverage_tests clean_validation_tests
clean_failed_tests				- runs clean_failed_regression_tests clean_failed_coverage_tests clean_failed_validation_tests

2.1.1. How to build using a makefile

In order to build the btree framework without cmake using a makefile follow the step below:

1) Clone the btree framework from github

cd /relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/
git clone https://github.com/andreas-steffens/btree-framework
cd btree-framework/src/btreetest

2) Add the following files to your build

/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/btree-frameworkspecific_data_classes/btreemap.cpp
/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/btree-frameworkspecific_data_classes/btreearray.cpp
/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/btree-frameworkspecific_data_classes/btreekeysort.cpp
/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/btree-frameworkspecific_data_classes/btreemultiset.cpp
/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/btree-frameworkspecific_data_classes/btreeset.cpp
/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/btree-frameworkspecific_data_classes/btreemultimap.cpp
/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/btree-frameworkabstract_data_classes/btreeassociative.cpp

/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/btree-frameworkbase_class_stack/btreeif.cpp
/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/btree-frameworkbase_class_stack/btreebaseif.cpp

3) Add the following include directories to your build

/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/btree-framework
/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/btree-framework/specific_data_classes
/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/common/location/btree-framework/io/data_layer/target

4) Add the following optional build flags to your build

- _DEBUG
- BTREE_ITERATOR_REGISTRATION

Please find the description of these build flags in section "2.3. build flags".


2.2. Windows

For this framework to compile, at least Visual Studio 2013 Express or a compiler that supports the C++11 dialect is required.
This release was tested with: Visual Studio Express 2013 Version: 12.0.40629.00 (update 5)

To build the b-tree regression test system:
1. Create a new project
2. Copy files from this release to your project location
3. The project needs to be aware of the following include locations:
/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/project/location/btree-framework
/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/project/location/btree-framework/specific_data_classes
/relative/or/absolute/path/to/your/project/location/btree-framework/io/data_layer/target
4. add the build flag "BTREE_ITERATOR_REGISTRATION" to the any build, if required (see below)


2.3. build flags

BTREE_ITERATOR_REGISTRATION:

If your code makes sure, that any b-tree framework iterator instance is destroyed before its respective associated container instance is destroyed, then the build flag BTREE_ITERATOR_REGISTRATION can be omitted, otherwise you would be facing access violations at run time. If your code doesn't make sure, iterators are destroyed before their associated container or you are in doubt, then enable the build flag BTREE_ITERATOR_REGISTRATION. Disabling this flag results in slightly faster code.

_DEBUG:

If the code is compiled to generate a debug binary, then this flag ought to enabled. It switches additional code for higher level debug functionality as well as performance counter code on. Furthermore, additional asserts are enabled to sanity check input parameters on lower level methods. In short: It enables code not required by a release build.


2.4. What has to be includes are required

If an STL compatible container class is required for the project, then see the table below:

include file		btree framework container		STL container

btreemultimap.h		CBTreeMultiMap					multimap
btreemap.h			CBTreeMap						map
btreemultiset.h		CBTreeMultiSet					multiset
btreeset.h			CBTreeSet						set

Depending on what other container type is required, at least one of the following files needs to be included:
btreekeysort.h	- includes ordered associative container: CBTreeKeySort
btreearray.h	- includes array type: CBTreeArray

Any of the above container types needs to know what data layer type is going to be used with it. This is set via the container's respective template parameter
Depending on what data layer will be in use, at least one of the following files needs to included:

include file		data layer type		property type				description

btreeioram.h		CBTreeFileIO		CBTreeIOpropertiesFile		contains everything required for the RAM data layer to work
btreeiofile.h		CBTreeRAMIO			CBTreeIOpropertiesRAM		contains everything required for the file data layer to work

Note: The above files also include their respective data layer property classes, so that additional includes are not needed.


3. Feedback

If you want to see updates or release on the btree-framework project, then follow this link:

If you want to contact me about this project, the email address below is what you want to use. Before you do so, read and understand this entire section, otherwise you might be wasting your time.

email: btreeframework@gmail.com


3.1. What increases the chances that I will respond to your email


3.1.1. A proper subject, which tells the context of what I am going to find in your email's body.

The subject ought to tell me briefly what the email is about. For instance:
"BUG: CBTree_classname::method_name - undefined behaviour in corner case"

The keyword at the beginning as well as the following text allow me to quickly assess what I am dealing with.
Also, the keyword allows to have filter rules in place. The subject currently is being filtered for the following keywords:

BUG: anything code related that is not behaving as documented
CODE: anything code related that ought to be implemented a different way
TEST: anything related to existing or missing regression tests or code coverage
DOC: anything document related, such as: Is content missing? Is something not explained well enough?
COMMENT: anything code related in terms of commenting, such as: an existing comment is misleading or not clear enough (you don't need to tell me about code that has not been commented yet)
QUESTION: any questing in terms of this project, which has not been answered anywhere else
ENHANCEMENT: anything related to this project that is an enhancement for everyone, such as: release procedures, file formats, folder structure etc.
OTHER: anything related to this project that has not been covered by any of the above keywords

If none of the keywords or an unknown keyword has been used, then your email is not lost, but won't be addressed for a very long time. Potentially for a period of time long enough, that the content becomes irrelevant. 

Neither the subject nor the email's body need to tell me that you are talking about the b-tree framework. If you send an email to the address above, then I am assuming that already.


3.1.2. An email body that gets to the point of what you want to say.

The rule of thumb to that end is: The more afford you have made on your side, the more I am inclined to believe you are actually interested in what you are doing. I mean: if you don't care, why should I? By afford, I don't mean that you have to write a tone of text. What I am asking for is a clear train of though, since it won't be you who has to understand your email, that will be me. Explain why you think something needs to be changed, enhanced, fixed, tested or is broken.
In terms of bugs, make sure it isn't a misinterpretation of the documentation or that you are looking at the wrong API function, because between different container types they can look very similar. Double check your findings and document them very well. I am asking you to do that, since your problem won't be the only one I will be dealing with. The more work you put into your request, the quicker I can resolve it and move on to the next request. In the long run it helps everyone.
Also, criticism is good, but everyone can criticise. At the very least, suggest how to do things better.


3.2. What decreases the chances that I will respond to your email


3.2.1. An empty or useless subject.

An empty subject or useless a subject like this: "OTHER: problem", just shows me that not much afford went into writing this email. How I feel about that has been explained above. A useless subject also includes misleading ones. If I see the keyword "BUG" in the subject, then I am expecting to see email content that is talking about code that is not behaving as documented. If that expectation is not met, then don't assume I will be putting much more afford into reading or understanding your message.


3.2.2. Email content that is confusing or off topic.

If I find your email confusing, misleading or off topic, then chances are that you are trying to talk about two or more subjects at once. If you want to talk about two different subjects, then write two emails. It also enables me to answer more to the point for each of your messages.
Also, in terms of off topic: Insults won't get you anywhere.


3.2.3. Content that has been covered by the documentation or is too obvious to warrant a reply.

If something has been covered by the documentation, then you will probably get a very short answer where to find it or none at all, depending on my work load. If I see a question like: "Hey, what's a b-tree?", you can be rest assured that I will remain silent.


3.2.4. Improper english.

First of all, I am not an english native speaker and at this point you probably have already spotted a number of grammar and spelling mistakes. Those are not what I mean by "Improper english". What I mean is content like this: "Yo, c my hax yo!"
It doesn't inspire any confidence and will just make me move on to the next email.
Also, what I don't like is when someone writes the letter "u" instead of the word "you" or similar shortcuts. This allows for room to doubt your motivation and once I have that room it is likely that I will divert my interest to something else, like the next email. Just don't allow me to have that room...
Shortcuts or abbreviations, which are within context, such as: "Ctrl+C", are fine though.
